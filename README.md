# Logitech Saitek Flight Throttle Quadrant ESP32 USB adapter
Usb adapter to connect Logitech / Saitek Flight Throttle Quadrant

This code is 100% generated by Google Antigravity - This is my first attempt to use this tool and this project is  like a proof of concept before more complex software.

The input information for antigravity was this forum: https://forum.arduino.cc/t/reverse-engineer-game-controller-with-custom-ps2-interface/564550
where aviator7 reversed engineered the communication protocol and pinout.

I asked antigravity to analyse the code and generate a more modern version for ESP32 S3 supermini dev board.
The code worked on first attempt.

# Wiring Guide: Saitek Yoke to ESP32 (Male Mini-DIN)

This guide details the connection between the male Mini-DIN connector of the Saitek Yoke cable and the ESP32-S3 Super Mini board.

## Pinout & Connections

The pin numbers below correspond to the standard **Male Mini-DIN-6** connector face (Pins facing you).

| Pin Position | Pin No. | Wire Color | Function | Connect to ESP32 Pin |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bottom Left** | **1** | **Blue** | Clock (SCK) | **GPIO 5** |
| **Bottom Right** | **2** | **Black** | Ready | **GPIO 6** |

| **Top Right** | **6** | **Green** | +5V | **5V** |

> [!NOTE]
> **Power**: Both Pin 3 (Red) and Pin 6 (Green) provide +5V. Connect them both to the ESP32 5V pin.

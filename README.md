# Logitech-Saitek-Flight-Throttle-Quadrant-ESP32-USB-adapter
Usb adapter to connect Logitech / Saitek Flight Throttle Quadrant

This code is 100% generated by Google Antigravity - This is my first attempt to use this tool and this project is  like a proof of concept before more complex software.

The input information for antigravity was this forum: https://forum.arduino.cc/t/reverse-engineer-game-controller-with-custom-ps2-interface/564550
where aviator7 reversed engineered the communication protocol and pinout.

I asked antigravity to analyse the code and generate a more modern version for ESP32 S3 supermini dev board.
The code worked on first attempt.
